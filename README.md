After installing the Ubuntu VM, to ensure our Ubuntu Linux system has the most up-to-date information about available software packages in the repositories, we run "sudo apt update" in the command prompt.

We need to install git by running "sudo apt install git" so we can clone the mail repository; the current git is the newest version.

To clone the email; <br />
Go to the Documents folder by going to the home directory by typing "~/Documents/" <br />
When in "Documents" folder clone the email by running "git clone "url of the mail""  <br />

We require an email client to interact with email message, preferrably "Mozilla Thundrbird", which is a free and open source option <br />
Open a terminal window > enter the command "sudo apt install thunderebird" <br />

<br />
To do some manual email file and header analysis, we need a text and code editor not just to rely on the terminal for the full analysis
We would be installing Sublime Text, an editor for code and different types of markup
Open Firefox > search "sublime text" > Click the first result > Install for linux
